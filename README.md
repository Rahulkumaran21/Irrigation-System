# 🌱 Smart Automated Irrigation System (IoT-Based)

## 📌 Project Description
The Smart Automated Irrigation System is an IoT-based solution designed to optimize agricultural water usage using real-time environmental monitoring. The system collects temperature, humidity, rainfall, and water level data and automatically controls irrigation using an ESP32-C3 microcontroller.

This project helps reduce water wastage, minimize manual labor, and improve crop productivity through intelligent automation.

## 🌾 Overview
Traditional irrigation methods often result in overwatering or underwatering, leading to inefficient water usage and reduced crop yield.

This system:
- Monitors environmental conditions in real-time  
- Automatically activates irrigation when required  
- Stops watering during rainfall  
- Allows remote monitoring via a mobile application  

The goal is to promote sustainable and smart agriculture.

## 🏗 System Architecture
1. Sensors collect environmental data.
2. ESP32-C3 processes the data.
3. If irrigation is needed:
   - Relay activates the water pump.
4. If rainfall is detected:
   - Irrigation is automatically stopped.
5. Data is displayed locally (LCD) and remotely (mobile app).
