# Irrigation-System
The Smart Automated Irrigation System is an IoT-enabled agricultural solution designed to optimize water usage using real-time environmental monitoring. The system uses sensors to measure temperature, humidity, rainfall, and water levels, and automatically controls irrigation based on intelligent decision-making through an ESP32-C3 microcontroller.
